Vaisseaux
---------

The Kestrel
^^^^^^^^^^^

Vaisseau de depart

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Humains
    * Armement: Level 3, 4 slots

    - 1x Artemis Missiles
    - 1x Burst Laser Mark II

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3
    * Bonus de Départ: Aucun

The layout of the ship's systems is decent with most of the major systems in 4
space rooms. However there are problems with venting in the fore of the ship,
and the location of the crew teleporter is a little far from the medbay.


Red-Tail
^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Kestrel
    * Equipage de départ: 2 Humains, 1 Zoltan, 1 Mantis
    * Armement: Level 4, 4 slots

    - 4x Defense Laser Mark I

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Bonus de Départ: aucun


This is the Type B layout of the Kestrel. It concentrates most of the ship's
systems towards the aft of the ship. The Red-Tail has an impressive 5
different rooms with access to space. The medical bay is conveniently placed
next to the crew teleporter on the port side of the ship. The rooms are
connected sensibly, but travel from fore to aft is slow due to the circular
arrangement of the back rooms and the lack of a central passage.


The Nesasio
^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Evenement Special in Engi Homeworlds

    - Requires: "3. (Engi Crew) Have your Engi crew member contact them."

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Humains

    * Shields (purchase): no starting shields

    * Armement: Level 2, 3 slots

    - 1x Mini Beam
    - 1x Dual Shot Laser

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Cloaking System: Level 1

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Long-Ranged Scanners: reveals data on adjacent FTL jump beacons
    - Titanium System Casing: chance to prevent system damage

The Nesasio is a stealth ship created by the Engi. This ship comes equipped
with a cloaking system but no shields. I'll say it plainly, this is not a
beginner's ship.

Without starting shields it takes a skilled captain to prevent too much damage
in the early sectors. The Nesasio also has horrible venting capabilities, so
fire and enemy boarding parties are a very real danger. Travel from fore to
aft is awkward because the doors are placed in alternating fashion port side
and starboard as you move towards the stern. This ship is very much designed
for stealth and evasion, and not so much for combat.


DA-SR 12
^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Nesasio

    * Equipage de départ: 2 Humains, 1 Zoltan

    * Shields (purchase): no starting shields

    * Armement: Level 4, 3 slots

    - 1x Glaive Beam

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 2

    * Cloaking System: Level 2

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Long-Ranged Scanners: reveals data on adjacent FTL jump beacons
    - Stealth Weapons (hidden, innate): firing does not shorten cloak duration

The Type B form of the stealth cruiser is laid out more symmetrically but
travel from front to back is still slow. Venting is only slightly improved
with two small openings in the rear near the engine. The DA-SR 12 has all of
the drawbacks of the Nesasio but instead of two weak, quick-firing weapons, it
has one very powerful beam that's slow to charge. I suggest upgrading the
cloaking system as soon as possible so you can charge up the Glaive Beam in
relative safety.


The Gila Monster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Special ship encounter in Mantis Homeworlds

    - Requires: Level 2 Medbay and a Crew Teleporter, save KazaaakplethKilik

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Mantis, 1 Engi

    * Armement: Level 1, 3 slots

    - 1x Small Bomb
    - 1x Defense Laser Mark I

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Crew Teleporter: Level 1, 2 spaces

    * Sensors (purchase): no starting sensors

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Mantis Pheromones: crew movement speed increased by 25%

It is odd that a Mantis ship does not have a sensor system when their race
focuses on crew combat. In any case, the ship's weapon and shield systems are
awkwardly located in the aft corners of the ship, and it takes some time to
travel to the crew teleporter on the opposite side. There are plenty of open
rooms for hull lasers, beams and missiles to cause double damage. On top of
that, Mantis are so very slow at repairs. This ship can be effective, but you
must somehow get more crew.


The Basilisk
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Gila Monster

    * Equipage de départ: 2 Mantis

    * Shields: Level 4, 2 layers

    * Armement: Level 1, 3 slots

    - no starting weapons

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Drone Control System: 2 slots

    - 1x Boarding Drone
    - 1x Defense Drone Mark I

    * Crew Teleporter: Level 1, 4 spaces

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Mantis Pheromones: crew movement speed increased by 25%

This Type B layout of the Mantis cruiser is completely focused on defeating
the enemy through boarding actions. The large, 4 person teleporter located
right next to the medbay makes overwhelming the enemy crew rather convenient
while the 2-layer shields protect the ship. Your crew is your only form of
attack until you can find or buy some other weapons. The rooms of the ship are
moderately accessible and venting is not a problem except in the wings. The
Basilisk is centered entirely on boarding actions and its design shows.


The Torus
^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Reach sector 5

    * Equipage de départ: 2 Engi, 1 Humain

    * Armement: Level 3, 3 slots

    - 1x Ion Blast Mark II

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Drone Control System: 3 slots

    - 1x Anti-Ship Drone Mark I

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Engi Med-bot Dispersal: heals crew anywhere on the ship at reduced speed

The Engi doughnut of doom is specially designed for drone combat. A wise
captain should buy a Drone Recovery Arm as soon as possible to alleviate the
strain on drone parts. Travel within the ship is slow, but there is not much
area to cover. Great care should be taken when faced with intruders and the
weak crew combat strength kept in mind when acquiring new crew members.


The Vortex
^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Torus

    * Equipage de départ: 1 Engi

    * Armement: Level 3, 3 slots

    - 1x Heavy Ion
    - 1x Heavy Laser

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 2

    * Drone Control System: 3 slots

    - 1x Anti-Personnel Drone
    - 2x System Repair Drone

    * Sensors (purchase): no starting sensors

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Drone Reactor Booster: drone movement increased by 50%

This Type B layout for the Engi Cruiser is even more compact than the Torus.
Narrow halls and lack of sensors hamper intruder defense, but your slow-moving
anti-pers. drone sped up by the starting augment adequately balances this
failing, at least in the early sectors. It's a lonely voyage with a crew of
one so efforts should be made to gather more members from wherever you can.


The Osprey
^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Defeat the rebel flagship and finish the game

    * Equipage de départ: 1 Humain, 1 Mantis, 1 Rockman, 1 Engi

    * Armement: Level 2, 4 slots

    - 1x Burst Laser Mark II

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Artillery Beam: Level 1, replaces cloaking system

    * Bonus de Départ: Aucun


This is the current front-line cruiser used by the Federation. A proper war
ship, the Osprey focuses on dealing out steady damage with its artillery beam.
The multi-racial crew will give you more options when heading out to alien
controlled sectors and has a good mix of combat and repair abilities. An
important fact to keep in mind is that the Federation cruiser design is very
long and doesn't have as many 4 space rooms compared some other ships.


The Nisos
^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Osprey

    * Equipage de départ: 1 Humain, 1 Zoltan, 1 Slug

    * Armement: Level 2, 4 slots

    - 1x Dual Shot Laser
    - 1x Leto Missiles

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 2

    * Artillery Beam: Level 2, replaces cloaking system

    * Bonus de Départ: Aucun


Much like the Osprey, this Type B Federation cruiser is made for ship-to-ship
combat. It has even less opportunities to gather the crew for anti-intruder
actions and the lack of air locks in the forward section may lead to problems.


Man of War
^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Special ship encounter in the Slug home nebula

    - Requires: Slug crew member or Level 2 Sensors

    1. "Let the live."
    2. "We don't want the weapon, we want information"

    * Equipage de départ: 2 Slugs

    * Armement: Level 3, 4 slots

    - 1x Anti-Bio Beam
    - 1x Breach Bomb Mark 1
    - 1x Dual Shot Laser

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Sensors (purchase): no starting sensors

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Slug Repair Gel: automatically seals hull breaches

The Slug ship is made for disabling shields and killing the enemy crew with
the anti-bio beam, an ideal salvager's vessel. The lack of sensors hurts less
than the lack of crew, and the compact arrangement means travel inside the
ship doesn't take too long. Once in a while you might run into problems with
the inconvenient placement of the oxygen system.


The Stormwalker
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Man of War

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Slugs

    * Armement: Level 3, 4 slots

    - 1x Healing Burst
    - 1x Artemis Missiles

    * Medbay (purchase): no starting medbay

    * Crew Teleporter: Level 1, 2 spaces

    * Sensors (purchase): no starting sensors

    * Door System: Level 2, Blast Doors

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Slug Repair Gel: automatically seals hull breaches

The Type B Slug cruiser is different from the Man of War in that it doesn't
exactly focus on killing the enemy crew. You'll need a medbay or a very large
supply of missiles before you can specialize in crew combat. The general
layout is a bit more spread out and the venting ability is significantly
better. With improved doors and better control of air supply, enemy boarders
shouldn't be much trouble.


The Bulwark
^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Evenement Special in Rock Homeworlds

    - Required: "1. We're going to save them or die trying." or

    2. "We're strong enough to destroy you!"

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Rockmen

    * Armement: Level 3, 4 slots

    - 1x Artemis Missiles
    - 1x Hull Missile

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Rock Plating: chance to ignore hull damage

Much like its Rockmen crew, this Rock ship is sturdy, if a bit slow. The
starting missiles are strong enough, but not likely to launch before enemy
fire has raked your ship. The ship's systems connect to the central rooms
through many doors and everything is arranged neatly in rows, though why the
middle rooms need to be divided is beyond me. With the entire crew made up of
slow Rockmen, you'll want to expand your crew as soon as you can. The venting
is rather good, but that should only matter if your Rockmen are occupied.


Shivan
^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Bulwark

    * Equipage de départ: 4 Rockmen

    * Oxygen System: Level 2

    * Armement: Level 3, 4 slots

    - 1x Heavy Pierce Laser Mark I
    - 1x Fire Bomb

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Door System (purchase): no starting door system

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Rock Plating: chance to ignore hull damage

The Type B Rock cruiser is distinctly suited for its Rockmen crew. With no
airlocks at all, the crew is the only way to put out fires. The Heavy Pierce I
will make short work of most ships in the starting sector. The accompanying
fire bomb will reduce enemy ship systems and crews to ashes while your immune
Rockmen smash everything in sight. I also just love how the ship looks. I
would quickly invest in a teleporter and improved doors if you don't want to
end up as scrap floating too close to a sun.


The Adjudicator
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Evenement Special in Zoltan Homeworlds

    2. "Hear them out." *suivre ensuite le marqueur de quete.*

    2. "Attempt to hail them."

    1. "Perhaps there could be a reconciliation..."

    2. "True progress can only be achieved without bloodshed."

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Zoltan

    * Armement: Level 3, 4 slots

    - 1x Halberd Beam
    - 1x Leto Missiles

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Zoltan Shield: absorbs any 5 damage and prevents enemy teleportation

does not prevent intruders from intruders written in text
recharges after every FTL jump

The Zoltan ship is very alien in appearance and arrangement. With most of its
major systems bunched in the starboard wing, this ship feels rather lopsided.
Don't let its strange design fool you. After some refits, this Zoltan ship can
quite a powerful ship, and the Zoltan Shield gives you a serious advantage
over the other ships you can choose from. This ship has potential, but you'll
need to buy and salvage all the weapons and crew you can find.


Noether
^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Adjudicator

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Zoltan

    * Shields: Level 1, no Layers

    * Armement: Level 4, 4 slots

    - 2x Ion Blast Mark I
    - 1x Pike Beam

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Bonus de Départ

    - Zoltan Shield: absorbs any 5 damage and prevents enemy teleportation

does not prevent intruders from intruders written in text
recharges after every FTL jump

Introducing the deadly Noether. The Type B Zoltan cruiser sets off from port
rather unbalanced. The starting weaponry can cut any ship into pieces for the
next 6 sectors, but it doesn't have any normal shields. That should be your
first order of business. You can collect weapons and crew at your leisure
through the first few sectors while building up the ship's defenses. One issue
you should take note of is the cramped rooms in the aft of the ship. This will
hinder you fighting off intruders with just the core crew of Zoltan.



Crystal
^^^^^^^

    - Lockdown power: seals the room for the duration of the effect
    - Reduced suffocation damage
    - Movement speed reduced by 20%
    - Has 125 health

    * Débloquer: Special distress call in Rock, Engi or Pirate controlled sector

    - Required: "A ship...within a nearby dense asteroid field..."

    1. "Search for the ship." and "2. Grab the stasis chamber."

    ou

    3. "(Rock Plating) Make a thorough search..."

    puis

    "You arrive at a Zoltan research facility."

    4. "(Damaged Stasis Pod) Ask if they can fix this."


Bravais
^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Evenement Special in Rock Homeworlds

    - Required: "3. (Crystal Crew) Reactivate it."

    * Equipage de départ: 2 Crystal, 2 Humains

    * Armement: Level 3, 4 slots

    - 1x Crystal Burst Mark I
    - 1x Heavy Crystal Mark I

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Bonus de Départ:

    - Crystal Vengeance: 10% chance for auto-counter attack when taking damage

Almost everything about the Crystal ship is slow. Its Crystal crew is slow,
its Crystal weapons are slow. It takes a long time to go from fore to aft.
Even so, the Crystal crew and weapons have such unique abilities that almost
all may be forgiven. Mantis may be the masters of crew combat, but Crystal can
control enemy territory like no other. Add to that the Crystal weapons can
pierce 1 shield. However, care should be taken when faced with Defense drones
because the Crystal weapons are considered projectiles.


Carnelian
^^^^^^^^^

    * Débloquer: Complete 2 of 3 achievements for the Bravais

    * Equipage de départ: 3 Crystal

    * Armement: Level 1, 4 slots

    - no starting weapons

    * Taille de l'Infirmerie: 3

    * Crew Teleporter: Level 1, 4 spaces

    * Cloaking System: Level 1

    * Bonus de Départ:

    - Crystal Vengeance: 10% chance for auto-counter attack when taking damage

The Type B Crystal cruiser is completely geared towards crew combat. With the
spacious 4 person teleporter next to the medbay, you don't have to worry about
your crew getting picked off before they can heal. The stealth systems help
you avoid the big guns while you take apart the enemy ship, and your three
Crystal crew ensure that no one can get in or out unless you want. The ship's
rooms are very inconvenient to move through, so you'll want to expand your
crew as soon as you are able.
