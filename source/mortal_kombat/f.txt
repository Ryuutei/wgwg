STAGES:

1) Armory: A remake from the original stage in MK2. Though sometimes
a glitchy floor when you do Reptile's Fatality in MK2 is no longer 
present, it is now back with the completely re-done, with a huge 
circular lave foundry in the middle.
2) Bell Tower: The return of the stage from MK3 that had the multi-tierd 
Stage Fatality. Though the Stage Fatality is no longer there, It returned, 
in a darker, and more true to the name looking stage
3) Courtyard: A return of one of the stage from the very first Mortal 
Kombat. Though the overall look is pretty identical, save for a fact that it
now sport a much crisper graphic, but this time, you can actually feel 
the background that gives you a feeling that you ARE in fact in an island.
4) Courtyard Night: Not just the original day stage, in this game, there's 
also, a darker night version of the stage. 
5) Deadpool: One of the famous stage in MK2 returns with even gorier, 
and more detailed Stage Fatality. In a lot more detailed, and crisper 
graphics. Perform your kharacter's Stage Fatality here, and you will be
greeted with one of the goriest Stage Fatality in the game.
6) Flesh Pits: A newly added stage in the new game. A stage where 
you see a bunch of experimental chambers with bodies in them. 
Unfortunately, there is no Stage Fatality here.
7) Goro's Lair: The original boss stage in the very first game returns 
with a darker, cave interior feel like new stage. With actual chair with 
Goro sitting on. If Goro's Lair in MK1 was outside of the the cave, this 
time on, it's inside of the cave.
8) Graveyard: Another, old MK3 stage returns. This time sporting a 
giant soul-nado on the background, in a darker and more sinister 
looking stage
9) Hell: Scorpion's Hell in UMK3 returns. Though the old skull-filled 
columns are gone, it was replaced with even more sinister looking 
corpses on fire hanging around. To make matters even scarier, there 
are cursed souls arms protruding out from the hellish ground. This 
stage also sports a cool Stage Fatality. Though rather a simple one. 
Perform your kharacter's stage fatality here.
10) Jade's Desert: The stage taht was in Ultimate MK3 returns. This time
in front of a giant stone grave of Queen Sindel, with a cool misty effect 
not present in UMK3.  Can you spot Cyrax in the desert this time? for the
developpers claims that they haven't forgotten about him in this game 
for this stage.
11) Koliseum: The old, MK2 boss stage returns in a lot more vast and 
3D background with a lively crowds chanting on, with Skarlet and Kitana
(sometimes Tanya) being captive on either side, instead of Kano and 
Sonya in MK2. With a beast called Tormentor on Shao Kahn's side. 
12) Living Forest: Famous, animated eerie stage of MK2 returns with 
even more realism. This time, with an actual Stage Fatality, and a good
one. Perform your kharacters' Stage Fatality here.
13) Pit: An original MK1's stage where you could uppercut your victim 
down to their doom is back with the famous Pit Fatality also returning. 
This time there is a day version without the moon, but Stage Fatality still
can be performed.
14) Pit Night: Same as the Pit of the day, but this time, you have a giant 
moon on the background, just like in the old days of MK1. Watch the 
moon carefully, for you can actually UNLOCK something here.
15) Pit Bottom: Remember the stage in MK1 where you get to fight 
against the secret kharacter Reptile? It's back, and been improved 
drastically. This time sporting the background statues that actually 
spits out the fall of blood!!!
16) Rooftop: Another stage from MK3 returns, in a greatly improved 
visuals
17) Shao Kahn's Throne Room: A new stage added on the new game. 
No stage fatality and a pure fighting arena.
18) Soul Chamber: A stage in MK3 returns with more animated 
background in a highly improved visuals.
19) Shang Tsung's Gardens Day/Night: Another 2 new stages that was
added in the new game. Nothing special, but another great looking 
background to do your battle on.
20) Shang Tsung's Throne Room: Another classic, MK1 stage returns,
with some additional effects. The windows were added on the 
background showing that it is pouring rain outside, and Shang once 
again, is seated, looking on the fight that is on the way.
21) Street: An old stage in MK3 returns. This time, with Tormentor doing
a battle and doing damage against the defense force on the 
background, where there are several hi-rise buildings. Some of them 
are on fire. Perform your kharacter's Stage Fatality here for a nifty new 
stage kill absent from MK3.
22) Subway: Another klassic stage from MK3 returns. With the Stage 
fatality retuning as well. This time, rather than just uppercutting your 
victim in front of the upcomming train, you actually wait for the train to 
come and bang your victim's head on the speeding train and toss 
him/her to another incomming train. BRUTAL.
23) Temple: Another klassic MK3 Stage returns, this time with a hidden 
secret. Can you find the secret battle hidden in this stage?
24) Tower: A klassic MK2 stage returns with a sharply re-done graphics
and an upgraded outside view though the huge window behind the 
Shadow Priest.
25) Wastelands: A reddish, wasteland stage in MK2 returns in the new 
game with a completely different look that rather feels like you are in a 
deserted ancient world in a much crispier graphics.

Rumors:
----------------------------------------------------------------

There is only two as of now. 
1) Fujin, one of the new kharacter who debuted in MK4 Arcade has been
leaked by what seems like a test footage by the MK team. A generic male 
kharacter who have no special moves or attacked programmed in, when
you pick him, the announcer say his name. Fujin. Other than that, he 
hasn't been confirmed. He could be just a placeholder for a new, 
un-revealed DLC, while Kenshi, the blind swordman from MKDA, and 
Rain, the Purple Ninja from UMK3 Arcade are now been confirmed as an
upcomming DLC.

2) 6 Additional Klassic Kostumes are in the works: It could be just a 
rumor now, but we would never know....
