#. bars filled: Breaker: When your opponent attacks, if you have the Y bars filled on your meter, holding block and move forward will break your opponent's attack, giving you a breather and a chance to counter.
#. bars filled: X-Ray: A big X will appear on the side of your meter.  Signaling you that you can perform your character's most vicious super attack, called X-Ray. Simply hit your Y bottom bumpers（LT + RT on X-Box 360, or L2 + R2 on PS3） Simultaneously, or simply hold Block, and Attack A and X together to perform the X-ray attack when you have full meter.

Fatalities
__________

*Just like in the old 2D days, All Fatalities now require a different distance per fatality in order for them to work*

- Sweep: About one and one and a half steps away from your opponent
- Jumps: The distance where, if you stand next to your opponent, and jump back once.
- Far/Full Screen: You and your opponent must be at the opposite corner of the screen

**NOTE: Babalities must be done at least at Jumps length, and it won't work if you used any blocks in the final round, just like in the old days.  HOWEVER, X-ray attacks, which involves Block, ARE allowed**

Babality on Bosses
------------------

- Goro/Kintaro: Play the ladder in at least Medium Skill Level in 2 rounds each, Beat every opponent without continues. A single round loss is allowed, but you cannot lose a match. Finish Shang Tsung with a Babality, and do NOT use block（X-Ray is allowed however） on the final round on Goro/Kintaro, then, Goro/Kintaro will turn into a baby automatically and their babality will be triggered.

- Shao Kahn: Beat every opponent including Goro/Kintaro without continue in at least a medium skill level, 2 rounds each in the ladder.  You can lose a round, but no matches. Finish all your opponents with the Babality, then beat Shao Kahn without continue and do NOT use block on the final round to turn Shao into a baby.

Stages
______

    #.  Armory: A remake from the original stage in MK2. Though sometimes a glitchy floor when you do Reptile's Fatality in MK2 is no longer present, it is now back with the completely re-done, with a huge circular lave foundry in the middle.
    #.  Bell Tower: The return of the stage from MK3 that had the multi-tierd Stage Fatality. Though the Stage Fatality is no longer there, It returned, in a darker, and more true to the name looking stage
    #.  Courtyard: A return of one of the stage from the very first Mortal Kombat. Though the overall look is pretty identical, save for a fact that it now sport a much crisper graphic, but this time, you can actually feel the background that gives you a feeling that you ARE in fact in an island.
    #.  Courtyard Night: Not just the original day stage, in this game, there's also, a darker night version of the stage.
    #.  Deadpool: One of the famous stage in MK2 returns with even gorier, and more detailed Stage Fatality. In a lot more detailed, and crisper graphics. Perform your character's Stage Fatality here, and you will be greeted with one of the goriest Stage Fatality in the game.
    #.  Flesh Pits: A newly added stage in the new game. A stage where you see a bunch of experimental chambers with bodies in them.  Unfortunately, there is no Stage Fatality here.
    #.  Goro's Lair: The original boss stage in the very first game returns with a darker, cave interior feel like new stage. With actual chair with Goro sitting on. If Goro's Lair in MK1 was outside of the the cave, this time on, it's inside of the cave.
    #.  Graveyard: Another, old MK3 stage returns. This time sporting a giant soul-nado on the background, in a darker and more sinister looking stage
    #.  Hell: Scorpion's Hell in UMK3 returns. Though the old skull-filled columns are gone, it was replaced with even more sinister looking corpses on fire hanging around. To make matters even scarier, there are cursed souls arms protruding out from the hellish ground. This stage also sports a cool Stage Fatality. Though rather a simple one.  Perform your character's stage fatality here.
    #.  Jade's Desert: The stage that was in Ultimate MK3 returns. This time in front of a giant stone grave of Queen Sindel, with a cool misty effect not present in UMK3.  Can you spot Cyrax in the desert this time? for the developpers claims that they haven't forgotten about him in this game for this stage.
    #.  Koliseum: The old, MK2 boss stage returns in a lot more vast and 3↓ background with a lively crowds chanting on, with Skarlet and Kitana （sometimes Tanya） being captive on either side, instead of Kano and Sonya in MK2. With a beast called Tormentor on Shao Kahn's side.
    #.  Living Forest: Famous, animated eerie stage of MK2 returns with even more realism. This time, with an actual Stage Fatality, and a good one. Perform your characters' Stage Fatality here.
    #.  Pit: An original MK1's stage where you could uppercut your victim down to their doom is back with the famous Pit Fatality also returning.  This time there is a day version without the moon, but Stage Fatality still can be performed.
    #.  Pit Night: Same as the Pit of the day, but this time, you have a giant moon on the background, just like in the old days of MK1. Watch the moon carefully, for you can actually UNLOCK something here.
    #.  Pit Bottom: Remember the stage in MK1 where you get to fight against the secret character Reptile? It's back, and been improved drastically. This time sporting the background statues that actually spits out the fall of blood!!!
    #.  Rooftop: Another stage from MK3 returns, in a greatly improved visuals
    #.  Shao Kahn's Throne Room: A new stage added on the new game.  No stage fatality and a pure fighting arena.
    #.  Soul Chamber: A stage in MK3 returns with more animated background in a highly improved visuals.
    #.  Shang Tsung's Gardens Day/Night: Another 2 new stages that was added in the new game. Nothing special, but another great looking background to do your battle on.
    #.  Shang Tsung's Throne Room: Another classic, MK1 stage returns, with some additional effects. The windows were added on the background showing that it is pouring rain outside, and Shang once again, is seated, looking on the fight that is on the way.
    #.  Street: An old stage in MK3 returns. This time, with Tormentor doing a battle and doing damage against the defense force on the background, where there are several hi-rise buildings. Some of them are on fire. Perform your character's Stage Fatality here for a nifty new stage kill absent from MK3.
    #.  Subway: Another klassic stage from MK3 returns. With the Stage fatality retuning as well. This time, rather than just uppercutting your victim in front of the upcomming train, you actually wait for the train to come and bang your victim's head on the speeding train and toss him/her to another incomming train. BRUTAL.
    #.  Temple: Another klassic MK3 Stage returns, this time with a hidden secret. Can you find the secret battle hidden in this stage?
    #.  Tower: A klassic MK2 stage returns with a sharply re-done graphics and an upgraded outside view though the huge window behind the Shadow Priest.
    #.  Wastelands: A reddish, wasteland stage in MK2 returns in the new game with a completely different look that rather feels like you are in a deserted ancient world in a much crispier graphics.
